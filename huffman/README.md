# huffman

An attempt at file compression using Huffman encoding.

**Note to self**: Writing tree-like data structures in Rust is hard. Come back
when you're better at Rust. It may be good to read
[this](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/index.html) first.

## To implement:

- an encoder
- a decoder
- file writer for encoding
- file reader for decoding
- CLI interaction.
